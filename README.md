to run the project: npm install > npm start

tech stack + tools used: 
- React
- Typescript
- Tailwindcss
- axios
- i18next
- react-chartjs-2

The tech I used is a mix of tech I'm familiar with and tech I'm currently in the process of learning (such as Tailwind) I want to show my eagerness of learning new things and also to show that I can get up to speed fast in any technology that is new to me

I went for a page that let's you see medication prices over time and also the number of hospitalizations, to show these charts I used react-chartjs-2 as it's really simple to set up and has plenty of nice graphs to choose from. Using i18next I've also implemented a bilingual app (Eng/Fr).

I would like to apologize for some of the lacking features such as a lack of responsive design. I've had a small amount of time to properly work on the project as I've had a very busy past week. However in order to implement responsive design, it would be a quick fix using tailwindcss responsive options. Time filtering is also missing but those are options that can also be modified on react-chartjs-2.

I would love to be part of the team and be able to discuss more about the project in the future.
